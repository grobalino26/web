  <h2>What is Hockey?</h2>
    
    <p><a href=https://www.nhl.com/>Hockey</a> is like soccer but on a smaller field made of ice. Instead of your feet (although you could use your feet if you want) you use a long stick to carry the puck instead of a ball. Hockey players use more equipment as well to protect themselves from the dangers of the sport. The goal of the game is to put the puck into the net more than the other team. There are normally 6 players on the ice for each team: the goalie, the center, two wingers, and two defensemen. </p>
 
    <p>There are three zones: the defensize zone, the neutral zone and the offensive zone. The zones are separated by blue lines. If a player crosses the offensive blue line before the puck the whistle is blown and play is stopped. That is called offsides. If the puck is is shot into the offensive zone from before the red line (the line in the middle of the neutral zone) and passes the goal line (the line the net is on) the whistle is blown and play is stopped. That is called icing.</p>

    <p>If a player commits a penalty (slashing, boarding, crosschecking, roughing, delay of game, high stick etc.) the whistle is blown when their team touched the puck and the player goes into the penalty box. This is a power play. On a power play the team with the player in the box can only have four skaters on the ice against the other team's five. This lasts for two minutes. During a power play the shorthanded team is allowed to ice the puck. If the team on the power play scores, the power play ends and it goes back to regular 5 on 5. If the penalty killers (the shorthanded team) commits another penalty, it turns into a 5 on 3.</p>

    <p>There are 3 twenty minute periods. If by the end of the third period the teams are stilled tied, the game goes to overtime. Overtime is a five minute period of 3 on 3. When someone scores the game ends. If no one scores the game goes to shootout. In a shootout a player from one team tries to score on the goalie with one shot. Then someone from the other team does the same. It is a best of three, whoever scores more goals wins. If both teams score the same number of goals in the three rounds, the rounds keep going until one team scores and the other doesn't.</p>
