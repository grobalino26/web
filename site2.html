  <h2>What is Hockey?</h1>
    
    <p><a href=https://www.nhl.com/>Hockey</a> is basically soccer but on a smaller field made of ice. Instead of your feet (although you could use your feet if you want) you use a long stick to carry the puck instead of a ball. Hockey players use more equipment as well to protect themselves from the dangers of the sport. The goal of the game is to put the puck into the net more than the other team. </h2>
