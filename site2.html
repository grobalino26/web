If the puck is is shot into the offensive zone from before the red line (the line in the middle of the neutral zone) and passes the goal line (the line the net is on) the whistle is blown and play is stopped. That is called icing.</p>

This is a power play. On a power play the team with the player in the box can only have four skaters on the ice against the other team's five. This lasts for two minutes. During a power play the shorthanded team... </p>
