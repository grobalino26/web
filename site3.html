  <h2>Why Hockey?</h1>
  
    <p>Hockey players are inherently tougher than other athletes. Have you <a href=https://www.gamedaynews.com/hockey/best-toothless-smiles-in-the-nhl/?view-all&chrome=1>seen</a> a professional hockey player? With their lack of teeth and beat up faces, they look like they came out of the Stone Age. This is because hockey a lot of physical contact. With people ramming into each other at high speeds, players taking 100mph shots to face, and bloody brawls happening every game, it is no wonder hockey players look the way they do. Hockey is just an exciting sport to watch and play. Constant high speed action. What more could you ask for? </h2>
