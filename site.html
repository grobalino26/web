  <h2>Intro</h2>
  
  <p>This site is about the sport of ice hockey. A crash course for dummies on what it is and how to play. The brief history of the sport from its start to now. And why hockey is such a great sport to watch and play. When I explain what hockey is I will be using the rules of the NHL which is the league for the United States and Canada. There are other leagues such as the KHL or OHL but the NHL is the top and most elite league.</p>
