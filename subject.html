  <h2>What is Hockey?</h1>
    
    <p><a href=https://www.nhl.com/>Hockey</a> is basically soccer but on a smaller field made of ice. Instead of your feet (although you could use your feet if you want)
    you use a long stick to carry the puck instead of a ball. Hockey players use more equipment as well to protect themselves from the
    dangers of the sport. The goal of the game is to put the puck into the net more than the other team. </h2>

  <h2>Why is Hockey Better than Every Other Sport?</h1>
  
    <p>Hockey players are inherently tougher than other athletes. Have you <a href=https://www.gamedaynews.com/hockey/best-toothless-smiles-in-the-nhl/?view-all&chrome=1>seen</a> a professional hockey player? With their lack of teeth
    and beat up faces, they look like they came out of the Stone Age. This is because hockey a lot of physical contact. With people ramming
    into each other at high speeds, players taking 100mph shots to face, and bloody brawls happening every game, it is no wonder hockey players look the way they do. Hockey is 
    just an exciting sport to watch and play. Constant high speed action. What more could you ask for? </h2>
