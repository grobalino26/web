  <h2>History of Hockey</h2>
    
    <p>Hockey is a very old sport. The NHL was founded back in 1917. But the NHL is not league that started hockey. But for that we should go way back. To ancient times. "Stick and ball" games have been played in numerous different cultures such as Egypt, Greece, the Americas, and France much later. But the ones that people believe are the fathers of hockey are 14th century games from Ireland, England, and Scotland. In the 17th century, people in Scotland began playing on ice, but with no skates. Then in England skates were introduced an people began playing with skates. In the 18th century, the word hockey was invented and people switched from wooden balls to pucks. In the 19th century, hockey became much more popular and replaced bandy in England. This is also the century that the sport reached Canada.</p>
  
    <p>In Montreal the rules of hockey were transformed from the English rules to rules closer to what we know today. Gradually these rules became the standard around the world. Eventually in 1917, the NHL was formed and became the top league. There are many teams that existed throughout NHL history that no longer exist today, but the 6 teams that existed around the beginning and in 1942 became the only 6 teams for a long time are now reffered to as the Original 6: the New York Rangers, the Boston Bruins, the Montreal Canadiens, the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Chicago Blackhawks, and the Detroit Red Wings. In 1967 the NHL made 6 new teams, the Pittsburgh Penguins, the Los Angeles Kings, the St. Louis Blues, the Philidelphia Flyers, the Minnesota North Stars, and the Oakland Seals. The Minnesota North Stars relocated to Dallas and became Dallas Stars. The Oakland Seals would eventually cease operations. Many more team joined, relocated, left throughout the past 50 years. Next year the Seattle Krakens will join the league and become the 32nd team. </p>
